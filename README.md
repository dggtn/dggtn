### About
<p>
I’m Daniela Gangotena, a current Bachelor of Information Technology Management student at UADE, specializing in systems management, software development, and the application of AI in business solutions. I’m also gaining hands-on experience in Front-End & Back-End Development, UX Design, Software Quality Assurance, and Data Science.

With a diverse background, I have experience in both the tech and business sectors. Most recently, I served as an Administration Assistant at Juan Granel Consumo Consciente for over four years, where I contributed significantly to the growth of a family-owned organic products business. I played a key role in streamlining operations, enhancing digital marketing efforts, and managing a global supply chain. My work in digital marketing led to an 80% increase in leads, and I also helped optimize internal workflows to improve operational efficiency. In addition, I represented the company at industry events, strengthening its brand presence and expanding networking opportunities.

Currently, I’m deepening my tech expertise through The ONE program at Alura, where I am learning advanced concepts in Java, Spring Framework, and testing, with over 650 hours of hands-on training. I’m also passionate about languages, holding certifications in French (B2 level) and German (B1 level), and I completed the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, which instilled in me a strong foundation in critical thinking and interdisciplinary learning.

I’m currently focused on expanding my technical skill set and exploring opportunities in software development, AI, and business technology solutions. I’m eager to collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between technology and business and continue growing as a versatile professional.
