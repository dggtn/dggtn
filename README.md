### About
<p>
I’m Daniela, a Bachelor of Information Technology Management student at UADE, specializing in systems management, software development, and AI in business. Currently, I’m working as an apprentice as a Tech Control Execution Analyst in a corporate company, gaining hands-on experience in tech and business.

I’ve completed a 650+ hour backend development course in Java and Spring Boot, strengthening my skills in backend technologies. I also have experience in Front-End & Back-End Development, UX Design, Software Quality Assurance, and Data Science.

Fluent in French (B2) and German (B1), I hold an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, which has sharpened my critical thinking and interdisciplinary approach. I’m passionate about expanding my expertise in software development, AI, and business tech solutions, and eager to contribute to innovative projects.
