### About
<p>
I’m Daniela Gangotena, a current Bachelor of Information Technology Management student at UADE, specializing in systems management, software development, and the application of AI in business solutions. I’m also gaining hands-on experience in Front-End & Back-End Development, UX Design, Software Quality Assurance, and Data Science.

With a diverse background, I have experience in both the tech and business sectors. 

Currently, I’m deepening my tech expertise through The ONE program at Alura, where I am learning advanced concepts in Java, Spring Framework, and testing, with over 650 hours of hands-on training. I’m also passionate about languages, holding certifications in French (B2 level) and German (B1 level), and I completed the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, which instilled in me a strong foundation in critical thinking and interdisciplinary learning.

I’m currently focused on expanding my technical skill set and exploring opportunities in software development, AI, and business technology solutions. I’m eager to collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between technology and business and continue growing as a versatile professional.
